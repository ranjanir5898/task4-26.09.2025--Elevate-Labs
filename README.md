# SQL for Data Analysis

This project analyzes ecommerce shipping data using SQL to uncover trends, optimize logistics, and assess customer satisfaction. The datasets and scripts provided demonstrate key techniques in data analysis and database optimization.
## Key Features and Steps

    1.Imported ecommerce shipping data into a PostgreSQL database for analysis.

    2.Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY to extract insights such as late deliveries, most expensive shipments, and average ratings per warehouse.

    3.Joined main shipment records with additional warehouse details using INNER, LEFT, and RIGHT JOIN to enrich the analysis.

    4.Utilized subqueries and aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) to compute total revenue, average discounts by shipment mode, and orders segmented by customer gender.

    5.Created SQL Views for streamlined queries, focusing on late shipments and average product cost per mode of shipment.

    6.Improved query performance by adding indexes on columns frequently used for filtering and grouping, such as ReachedonTimeYN and ModeofShipment.
## Files

    1.Ecommerce-Shipping-Data.csv: The primary dataset for analysis.

    2.task-4-sql.sql: SQL scripts containing all queries, views, and indexes used.

    3.task 4.pdf: Documentation and step-by-step writeup of the analysis.

## Output

    1.Query results showcase shipment behavior, warehouse performance, revenue summary, and segmentation by shipment mode and customer demographics.

    2.The project provides reusable views and indexes for efficient ongoing analysis.

This summary helps others quickly understand the logic, techniques, and structure of your ecommerce shipping data analysis repository.
